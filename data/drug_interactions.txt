## 2. Antibiotics
**Amoxicillin**
- **Interactions**:
  - Methotrexate: Can increase toxicity of methotrexate by reducing its excretion.
  - Warfarin: May increase bleeding tendency (INR monitoring recommended).
  - Allopurinol: Higher risk of skin rash.
- **Side Effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, skin rash, yeast infections.

**Azithromycin**
- **Interactions**:
  - Statins (e.g., Atorvastatin): Increased risk of muscle toxicity (rhabdomyolysis).
  - Warfarin: Potential increase in bleeding risk.
  - Antacids (Aluminum/Magnesium): Reduces absorption of Azithromycin (separate by 2 hours).
- **Side Effects**: Stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea.

## 3. Cardiovascular
**Lisinopril (ACE Inhibitor)**
- **Interactions**:
  - Potassium Supplements/Spironolactone: Risk of Hyperkalemia (high potassium).

  - Lithium: Increases lithium toxicity risk.
- **Side Effects**: Dry cough, dizziness, headache, high potassium levels.

**Atorvastatin (Statin)**
- **Interactions**:
  - Grapefruit Juice: Increases atorvastatin levels, leading to toxicity.
  - Erythromycin/Clarithromycin: Increases risk of muscle damage.
  - Cyclosporine: Increases risk of myopathy.
- **Side Effects**: Muscle pain, digestive problems, liver enzyme changes.

**Amlodipine (Calcium Channel Blocker)**
- **Interactions**:
  - Simvastatin: Amlodipine increases exposure to Simvastatin (limit Simvastatin to 20mg).
  - CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., Ketoconazole): Increases amlodipine levels.
- **Side Effects**: Swelling of ankles (edema), palpitations, flushing.

## 4. Antidiabetic
**Metformin**

## 6. Respiratory
**Albuterol (Salbutamol)**
- **Interactions**:
  - Beta-blockers: Can block the bronchodilator effect.
